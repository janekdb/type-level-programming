# type-level-programming
An exploration of type level programming in Scala

This project is the starting point for an exploration of type level programming in Scala.

Questions that will be explored include,

  - What comprises type level programming?
  - What problems are ameanable to solution by type level programming

And of course this will not be a proper exploration if some other technology was not bundled into the exploration. To
that end this will all be enabled by `sbt`.

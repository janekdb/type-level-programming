# type-level-programming

## An exploration of type level programming in Scala

This project is the starting point for an exploration of type level programming in Scala.

Questions that will be explored include,

  - What comprises type level programming?
  - How does Hello World map into type level programming? 
  - What problems are amenable to solution by type level programming?

And of course this would not be a proper exploration if some other technology was not bundled into the exploration. To
that end this will all be enabled by `sbt`.

## Background

I developed this itch following a demo by a colleague of https://github.com/fthomas/refined.

Project inception was 2015-August-17 in a Costa in Houndsditch oddly on the only day that coffee was not available. Here I am sipping tea.
